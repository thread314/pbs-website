                 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY POLICY AND
                               PROCEDURES
           __________________________________________________


1 Purpose
=========

  This policy is necessary because:
  - By the nature of the work being carried out, it is necessary for
    participants to entrust sensitive information to the practitioner.
  - It is also frequently necessary, in line with best practices in PBS,
    to communicate and share information amongst stakeholders, which
    will often include staff of other organisations.
  - Participants have the legal right to determine how their information
    is handled and with whom it is shared.
  - There are also some rare circumstances when the practitioner is
    obliged to share the client's information with external parties,
    potentially without the client's knowledge or consent (when ordered
    by a court or statutory authority, or where there is serious safety
    risk).


2 Policy Statement
==================

  This policy will achieve the following:
  - Clients will be informed how their information is stored and the
    circumstances under which it is shared with external parties.
  - Information shared by clients with the practitioner will be kept
    private and confidential at all times, unless:
    - They have provided consent for the information to be shared with
      other stakeholders involved in the case
    - They have provided consent for independent auditors, NDIS Quality
      and Safeguards Commission and/or the National Disability Insurance
      Agency to review their information (for instance for quality
      assurance purposes).
    - Exigent circumstances oblige the practitioner to share the
      information with external parties. These circumstances can
      include:
      - when sharing the information is necessary to safeguard the
        participant or others (as outlined in the Safeguarding Policy),
      - when subpoenaed by a legal entity, and
      - under reporting requirements (including NDIS reportable
        incidents requirements).


3 Procedures
============

  In order to achieve the above, the following steps will be followed.
  - All participants (or their guardian) will provide written consent to
    the collection and sharing of their information (via the service
    agreement).
  - All clients will be informed of the limits of confidentiality (as
    above) at the outset of service.
  - Information will only be shared with other parties when the client
    has given consent (except where the law requires otherwise).
  - Clients will sign a new service agreement at the commencement of
    each new plan period.
  - Clients will be informed how they can withdraw their consent for the
    organisation to handle or share their information at any time.
  - Any client information shared with external parties, in the course
    of professional development (for instance, clinical supervision)
    will have all identifying details removed/obscured.
  - All information pertaining to reportable incidents will be kept for
    a period of at least seven years.
  - Participants can request access to, or correction of, their personal
    information at any time; requests will be actioned within 30 days.
  - In the event of a notifiable data breach, the practitioner will
    comply with the Notifiable Data Breach scheme requirements,
    including notifying affected individuals and the OAIC.
  - Privacy enquiries can be directed to Eddie Drury (Privacy Officer)
    via eddie@eddiedrurypbs.com.au or 0412 121 003.
  Client's information will be stored securely through the following
  means:
  - Digital client records will only be stored on password protected
    devices, with full-disk encryption.
  - Physical copies of information will be stored securely (ie held with
    the practitioner or in locked premises).
  - All physical copies of data must be destroyed once they are no
    longer required.
  - Third-party IT services contracted to store client information (eg
    email servers/off-site backup services) must be delivered by
    well-known, reputable companies, with policies explicitly outlining
    that their staff are never permitted access to the information.
